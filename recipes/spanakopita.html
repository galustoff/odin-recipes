		<h2>Ingridients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
			<li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>2 pounds spinach, rinsed and chopped</li>
			<li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
			<li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
			<li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
			<li>8 sheets phyllo dough</li>
			<li>¼ cup olive oil, or as needed</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9-inch
				square baking pan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute
				chopped onion, green onions, and garlic in the hot oil until soft and
				lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir in spinach and parsley, and continue to saute until spinach is
				limp, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl until well
				combined. Stir in spinach mixture.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush
				lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and
				brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo
				dough; the sheets will overlap the pan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread spinach and cheese mixture into the pan. Fold any overhanging
				dough over the filling. Brush with oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Layer the remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil.
				Tuck overhanging dough into the pan to seal the filling.
			</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
			<li>Cut into squares and serve while hot.</li>
